Hello! My name is Ethan and I'm a first year math PhD student at the University of Utah.
I'm still very much in the figuring out research interests phase of things, but at the moment I'm especially drawn to
representation theory and commutative algebra. 

Outside of math, I enjoy riding bikes on and off-road, baking bread, 
and exploring the wilderness in search of cool bugs with my partner. Linked above is our collaborative website, where
you can find pictures of the best ones.
