Hello! My name is Ethan and I'm a third year math PhD student at the University of Utah.
My advisor is Anurag Singh.

I am one of the organizers of [BIKES](https://bagels-bikes.github.io/bikes/), our commutative algebra student seminar, together with Jorge Gaspar Lara.
Along with a handful of friends, I'm also helping to carry on the tradition of the [Living Room Exchange of Mathematics](https://sites.google.com/view/livreofmathematics).

Outside of math, I enjoy riding bikes, drinking tea, baking bread, 
and exploring the wilderness in search of cool bugs with my partner. Linked above is our collaborative website, where
you can find pictures of the best ones.
